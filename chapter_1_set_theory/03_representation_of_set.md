**Representation of set**

Tabular/Roster representation of a set:
Listing its members in a set is called Tabular/Roster representation of a set.

ex:
    A = {a,e,i,o,u}
    B = {1,2,3,4}
    C = {----- -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, -----}

Set builder representation of a set:

Here we specify the property which the elements of the set must satisfy.

ex:
    A = {x | x is an odd positive number less than 10}
    B = {x | x ∈ English alphabet && x is a vowel}
    C = {x | x ∈ Z && x%2 =0}
