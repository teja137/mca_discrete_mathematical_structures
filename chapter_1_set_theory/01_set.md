**What is a set?**

- Sets are the fundamental discrete structures on which all the discrete structures are built
- Sets are used to group objects together
- An unordered, well-defined collection of distinct objects of same type
- No duplications allowed

ex:
    A = {0,2,4,6----}
    B = {2,3,5,-----}
    C = {x | x ∈ Natural number}

A Set is generally denoted usually by upper case letter. 
ex:
    A = {1,2,3}
The objects of a set are called the elements or members of the set.
A set is said to contain its elements.
Lower case letters are generally used to denote the elements of the set.
ex:
    A = {a,b,c}

x ∈ A means element x is a member of A
x ∉ A means elements x is not a member of A

∈ means is a member or you can say belongs to
∉ means is not a member or you can say does not belongs to
