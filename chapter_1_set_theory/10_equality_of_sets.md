**Equality of sets**

If two sets A and B have the same elements and therefor every element of A also belongs to B and every element of B also belongs to A, then the set A and B are said to be equal and written as A=B.

if A⊂B and B⊂A, then A=B

∀x(x ∈ A ↔ x ∈ B) - For all or for every x, x is an element of A if and only if x is an element of B.

∀ = universal quantifier
