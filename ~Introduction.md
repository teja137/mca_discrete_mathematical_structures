what is Discrete Mathematical Structures?

Discrete Mathematical Structures is the study of Discrete objects.
- Discrete means "distinct or not connected".

Discrete Mathematical Structures (often just called Discrete Math) is a branch of mathematics that deals with discrete elements rather than continuous ones.
    - Discrete elements are like blocks or steps you can count individually, with nothing in between them.
        ex:
        Natural numbers - 1,2,3,4,5
        people in a room
        dice
    - Continuous elements are values that flow smoothly and have no gaps or jumps between them. 
        ex:
        Real numbers - 0 - 1 = 0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5, and so on
        Time - between 1:00pm - 2:00pm we have 1:30, 1:45, 1:59.999, and so on 

We study it for developing logical thinking and problem-solving skills, particularly for algorithms, data structures, and system modeling.
