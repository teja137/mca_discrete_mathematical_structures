Subset of a set:
If every element of a set A is also an element of set B i.e. ∀x(x ∈ A -> x ∈ B), then A is called subset of B and is written as A ⊆ B. B is called the superset of A.

Ex:
    A = {1,2,3}
    B = {1,2,3,4,5}
    1,2,3 is in A and B
    so A ⊆ B, means A is the subset(⊆) of B
    and also we can say B ⊇ A means B is the superset(⊇) of A

Note:
To show that A is not a subset of B (A ⊈ B), we only need to find one element x ∈ A with x ∉ B.
To show that A ⊆ B, shaw that if x ∈ A, then x ∈ B

∅ ⊆ A, Empty set ∅ is a subset of every set.
A ⊆ U, Every set is a subset of Universal set U.
A ⊆ A, Every set is a subset of itself.
